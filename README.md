* The text prompt:
  * Describe an object that can be represented in geometric shapes, not nebulous concepts such as "a tiger" or "the universe", unless you're just curious what it does with that üòè 
  * Be as explicit as possible. For example, if you want a plate with 4 holes, say where you want the holes placed and how big of a diameter each should have 
  * Our ML models are better at describing single objects than assemblies for now
* The output format:
  * This is required as the model needs to be downloaded and saved locally.
* The output directory:
  * Where the downloaded model should be saved. If you need to re-access this model for any reason or want to download in a different format you can go back to your [dashboard](https://text-to-cad.zoo.dev/dashboard)
